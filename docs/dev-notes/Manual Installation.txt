Manual Installation

This project is not yet available on PyPi, my bad; however, if you:

	1. download this repo
	2. unarchive it
	3. create a virtual python environment
	4. activate the virtual environment
	5. install pillow

then IMM should run. Starting with step #3 above...

	pyvenv IMM_VENV
	IMM_VENV\Scripts\activate.bat
	pip install pillow
	python imm.py
